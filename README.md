An old wizard waits. Ask your questions. Find the word that opens the gate.

## Quick start
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

## Build for GitHub Pages
- `npm run build`
- The static site lives in `docs/` (Pages → Deploy from a branch → main → /docs).

## Hints

- Speak it plainly; the gate listens.
